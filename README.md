# Deep Learning

Welcome to the Deep Learning repository! This repository contains implementations of Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for various tasks.

## Overview

In this repository, you can find implementations of Deep Learning models and algorithms for different tasks, including image classification and stock trading prediction.

## Neural Network for MNIST Classification

### Description
- In the `Simple_ANN.py` file, you'll find an easy implementation of a Neural Network using the MNIST dataset.
- The Neural Network is trained to predict which number, written by a human, is in the image.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

### Description
- In the `Trailing and actions of stocks` carpet, you'll find the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning model for stock trading prediction.
- This code is based on a previous implementation, which has been updated with new libraries and adapted to our project.
