# Deep_Learning

In this repository you can find .py and ''.

In .py you can find an easy implementation of Neural Network using the MNIST dataset to predict which number, written by a human, is in the image.

On the other hand in Trailing and actions of stocks you can find the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning code. This code wasn't create by scratch, we took one code create before, updated with new libraries and adapted to our project.
